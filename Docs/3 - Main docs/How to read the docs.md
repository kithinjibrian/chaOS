# How to read the docs
To maximize the benefit of chaOS documentation, understanding its structure and navigation is crucial. The documentation leverages the Zettelkasten note-taking method explained in [[How to write the docs]], creating a web of interconnected notes linked by tags and links. To fully explore this network, you'll need software like [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download) that supports this method.

## Charting Your Course

Here's how to navigate the chaOS knowledge landscape:

- **Harnessing the Power of Tags:** Tags are your allies in finding relevant content. Each document can have multiple tags, allowing you to discover all notes on a specific topic. This helps you understand various aspects of a feature or concept.
- **Following the Links:** The documentation seamlessly connects related content through links. By following these links, you can explore the relationships between ideas and features, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the project.
- **Understanding the Stage:** Each document has a stage label ( #drafting, #revising, #editing, #published) indicating its development phase. This helps you assess the information's completeness and potential for change.

## Tips for Exploration

- **Start with the Main Docs:** New to chaOS? Begin your journey with the main docs. They offer a user-friendly, high-level overview of the project, its goals, and getting started instructions.
- **Unlocking Deep Knowledge with Source Docs:** Once comfortable with the basics, explore the source docs for in-depth knowledge of specific features and concepts. These documents reveal the background research, reasoning, and external sources (web links, books, etc.) that influenced chaOS's development.

By following these tips and embracing the Zettelkasten method, you can unlock the full potential of the chaOS documentation, empowering you to navigate its depths and gain valuable insights.
