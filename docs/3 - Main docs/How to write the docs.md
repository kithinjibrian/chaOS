# How to write the docs

The documentation in chaOS follows the Zettelkasten note-taking method, which helps keep information organized and easy to find. There are three types of documentation in chaOS:

1. **Rough docs**: Rough docs are the initial notes. They are informal and can include raw ideas, problems, or questions that come up while working. These notes don't need to be polished; they are just for keeping track of your thoughts and progress as you develop.
2. **Source docs**: Source docs provide information on the materials and resources a developer used to implement a feature in chaOS. These documents might include articles, research papers, tutorials, or any other references that helped in understanding how to build a specific feature. When writing source docs, always summarize the source material in your own words and include a reference so others can easily find and understand it. This helps create a clear path from the original idea to the final implementation.
3. **Main docs**: Main docs are the official documentation for chaOS. They include tutorials and manuals that explain how to use chaOS, its features, and how to contribute to its development.

## Stages of Documentation

There are 4 stages a document can be in:

1. #drafting: This is the initial stage where you write the first version of the document.
2. #revising: Once you have a draft, you can review it for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Make necessary changes to improve the document.
3. #editing: After revising, the document can be edited for grammar, spelling, and style.
4. #published: Once the document has been reviewed and edited, it moves to the published stage. This is the final form of the document. At this point, the document should be polished, accurate, and complete, providing valuable information to anyone reading it.

## Tagging and Linking

**Tagging:** Tagging documentation helps organize it by topic and makes it easier to find later. You can tag a document with multiple tags to cover different topics, and you are free to create new tags as needed. The goal of tagging is to enhance flexibility and not to limit your thinking, so feel free to tag documents in any way that makes sense to you. This way, you can quickly locate related documents and see the connections between different topics.

**Linking:** This is a key feature of the Zettelkasten method. By linking relevant main docs as you write your documentation, you can see how your web of knowledge grows. This can lead to new ideas, connections, and insights.

## Writing the docs
Now that you understand the method we use for writing documentation, it’s time to put it into practice. We recommend using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download) for writing your documentation, as it integrates well with the Zettelkasten note-taking method. Obsidian allows you to easily link notes, tag content, and organize your ideas, making it an excellent tool for maintaining chaOS documentation.

At chaOS, we take documentation seriously because this is a learning project. Our goal is to create a valuable resource for everyone involved, whether you’re writing code, documenting processes, or just exploring new concepts. As you write your code, remember to document it thoughtfully to contribute to the collective knowledge and help others learn and understand the development journey.

Your contributions make a difference, so take the time to document your work thoroughly and clearly.
